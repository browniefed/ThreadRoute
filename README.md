#Thread Route
===============

An interesting idea to get the most minimum product of what people care about when waiting for the bus.
The idea being that people don't care about how long they have to wait they just want to know where the next bus is at.

Using D3 and predefined routes of buses we can outline the street directions that it will take and slowly erode it away like a fuse.
We can toss some metrics up and do a few calculations, how long the bus may be taking. In the end I don't care I just want to watch a line slowly disappear and turn into a bus.
